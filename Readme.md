# The Book library

I am pleased to present you my console application!

This app is designed to origanize and simplify work 
of librarians in console aesthetic way.
The application allows you to add, edit, and delete
books, as well as customers, and perform operations:
take books from the library and return them. And all
this is accompanied by an incredible console
graphical interface.

## Usage

Get ready to be surprised! But the interaction with
the program is through the console. For this purpose,
the application has a virtual command line.
